The acts stated that no trade could be carried on between Great Britain and its colonies except in vessels built and manned by British subjects. Additionally, no European goods could be brought to America except in the ships of the country that produced them or in English ships. These laws were detrimental to Dutch shipping in America and caused the colonists to pay higher freight rates. However, the British navy also provided protection to the colonies, preventing Holland, Spain, and France from wiping out their settlements. Despite the regulation of their manufacture and trade being controlled in the interests of the mother country, the colonists also enjoyed great advantages in her markets. Free trade did not exist anywhere on earth, but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and merchandise. It could be said that the disadvantages the colonists suffered through British regulation of their trade were offset by the protection of the British navy.'"
